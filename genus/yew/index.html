<h2>Yew</h2>

  <UL>
    <LI>'Sorrow', 'Immortality', 'Perspective', 'Omen of Doom'.
    <LI>Also both 'Death' and 'Eternal Life' in Greece!
    <LI>Planted on plague graves for purification and protection.
    <LI>The Romans believed it grew in Hell.
    <LI>Norse and Celtic people thought it prevented bewitching and death.
    <LI>Christians believed its poison protected the dead.
    <LI>Branches are carried on Palm Sunday and at funerals.
    <LI>The trees were used to make the famous English Longbows of the successful
        battles of Crecy (26/8/1346), Poitiers (19/9/1356) and Azincourt/Agincourt (25/10/1415).
        English and Welsh archers could fire 12 arrows a minute, far faster than the Genoese
        (French) crossbow mercenaries.
    <LI>At Twyford Churchyard, there is a Yew tree over a thousand years old.
    <LI>According to folklore, an ancient Yew in Great Pepsells Field at Furneux Pelham
        (North Hertfordshire) grew a few feet from an ancient Roman road, and by the
        18th century the trunk had split and steps had been set inside for a stile, to
        allow people to walk through the tree. At this time, the tree is believed to
        have been around 1500 years old. In the 1830s, while removing the stump and
        roots to create more arable land, farm labourers discovered golden objects within
        the roots, which some claimed were from a dragon's lair &mdash; at Brent Pelham Church
        lies the tomb of 'Piers Shonks', whose Latin inscription refers to the slaying of a dragon!
    <li>Ancient people regarded the yew tree as a portal to an unknown world.</li>
    <li>In the Irish tale of <i>Deirdre of the Sorrows</i>, two yew trees grew from
        the grave of the heroine Deirdre and intertwined in a strong lock over the
        roof of St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh.</li>
